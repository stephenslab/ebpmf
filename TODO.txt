## To do

* Add ebpmf_point_gamma

* Find a way to compare RMSE between oracle and fitted

* Try on real genetics data


Problem:

* point gamma has to be initialized using exponential mixture (as otherwise its training likelihood cannot beat oracle). Initialization needs to be studied.

* ELBO often decreases! though  RMSE (on lambda)  is  good
